%the result is different if the first constraint has a higher weight or higher level
% [100:1] or [1:100]
%[weight : level]

%Under prioritization, the semantics minimizes the violation of the constraints of
%the highest priority level first; then the lower priority levels are considered one
% after the other in descending order.

%In the presence of weights, best models minimize the sum of the weights of the
%violated weak constraints
